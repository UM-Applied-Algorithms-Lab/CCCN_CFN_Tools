\usage{
MakeCorrelationNetwork(
  common.clusters,
  ptm.correlation.matrix,
  ptm.cccn.name = "ptm.cccn",
  gene.cccn.name = "gene.cccn"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{common.clusters}{A list of clusters. Ideally the ones found by MakeClusterList in common_clusters}

\item{ptm.correlation.matrix}{A data frame showing the correlation between ptms (as the rows and the columns). NAs are placed along the diagonal.}

\item{ptm.cccn.name}{Desired name of the PTM correlation matrix filtered by specific PTMs from input}

\item{gene.cccn.name}{Desired name for the cocluster correlation network; defaults to gene.cccn}
}
\value{
The list of common clusters between all three distance metrics (Euclidean, Spearman, and SED) and a matrix showing strength of relationships between proteins using the common clusters between the three distance metrics (Euclidean, Spearman, and Combined (SED))
}
\description{
Make Correlation Network filters a correlation matrix of PTMs by specific PTMs.
It groups the PTM correlation matrix based on the Genes of PTMs.
By summing these submatrices, it also produces a gene by gene cocluster correlation network shows strength of relationships between proteins using the common clusters between the three distance metrics.

\examples{
ex.ptm.cor <- ex.ptm.correlation.matrix
MakeCorrelationNetwork(ex.clusters.list, ex.ptm.cor, 1, "ex.clusters.common", "ex.ptm.cccn", "ex.gene.cccn")
print(ex.clusters.common[c(1, 2, 3)])
utils::head(ex.gene.cccn[, c(1,2,3,4,5)])
