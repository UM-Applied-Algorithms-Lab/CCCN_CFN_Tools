This is a step-by-step guide on using the first twelve functions of the CCCN CFN Tools package. First, there are brief descriptions of each function, followed by an in depth look at actually running them. Please note that certain parts of this can take up to an hour to run.

(Potential Notes here about needed hardware and OS requirements. Function names can also be changed as needed.)

# Function Descriptions


### Make Cluster List:
Performs clustering analysis on t-SNE data. It takes your data table and an argument for cluster closeness as arguments. It first calls SpearmanDissimilarity and EuclideanDistance and then finds the average between the two fo them. Then, it calculates a spanning tree based on the distances in the t-SNE data and identifies clusters by computing connected components with the specified threshold. Finally, it saves three data frames to the user's global environment, each containing the genes assigned to a specific cluster with respect to that measure of distance.

### Find Common Clusters:
Calls MakeClusterList and then finds the common clusters between the clusters of each method of distance calculation. Generates a visual representation of this new common clusters set.

### List Common Cluster:
This looks for actual interactions and similarities between the new clusters for each of the results. It returns a new list within the given parameters.

### Generate and Construct PTMs Network:
The new cluster lists from above are used here to look for Post-Translational Modifications. It then merges these separate data frames for each cluster list into a single data frame. This function also goes through and changes non-existent values from 0 to NA so that they do not skew our results later on. There are also a number of secondary functions inside of this that could be used for adapting your own code.

### Make Adjecancy Matrix:
A fairly self explanatory function. This creates a matrix from your chosen data sets by combining them.

### Bind Matricies:
Aligns the adjacency matrix with the correlation matrix. Then sets diagonal connections to NA values.

### Correlation Network:
Turns the matrix created into an igraph object.

### Process PTM Data:
???

### Get Gene Names from Peptides:
???



# Example Pipeline:

These steps will take the unprocessed data set that we provide on GitHub and sort and filter it in several ways. Depending on your individual situation, you may want to only use some of these functions. We will run them sequentially so that you have example uses of each. The code snippets below will each be followed by descriptions. You can copy them into your own file or follow along by running the `PipelineMain.R` file.

For actually running this code, it is recommended that you have at least four CPU cores and 16 GB of memory (RAM).

---

### Step 1: MakeClusterList
```{r eval=FALSE}
MakeClusterList(ptmtable, toolong = 3.5)
View(eu_ptms_list)
save(eu_ptms_list, file = "eu_tptms_list.df")
View(sp_ptms_list)
save(sp_ptms_list, file = "sp_tptms_list.df")
View(sed_ptms_list)
save(sed_ptms_list, file = "sed_tptms_list.df")
```

The MakeClusterList function is employed to identify clusters within your dataset. To accomplish this, it first calculates Euclidean Distance, Spearman Dissimilarity (1 - |Spearman Correlation|), and the average of the two of these. Clustering then occurs to group similar post translational modifications based on the conditions under which they are activated. This helps in understanding relationships in the data. There is no output for this function. Instead, the cluster lists for each measure of distance are automatically saved into your global environment. From there, they can be viewed and saved with the built-in View and save functions.

Final Note: Avoid altering the output files' data types or names, as this can affect subsequent analyses.

### Step 1b: PlotClusters
```{r eval=FALSE}
common_clusters <- FindCommonCluster(ptmtable, toolong = 3.5, output_dir = "plots")
```

NOTE: This step is optional. Saves plots into the provided output directory but does not return anything.

This step uses the output from the MakeClusterList function to create plots. It organizes the data into clusters that are represented in the clusters for each measure of distance. The PlotClusters function then generates a visual graph that represents the relationships among the clusters. This graph is particularly useful for visualizing how different genes are modified post-translation under the same circumstances, providing insights into their biological pathways

### Step 2: GenerateAndConstructptmsNetwork
```{r eval=FALSE}
ptms_network <- GenerateAndConstructptmsNetwork(eu_ptms_list, sp_ptms_list, sed_ptms_list, ptmtable, keeplength = 2, output_dir = "plots")
print("All PTMs network:")
print(unique(sapply(as.character(element$Gene.Name), function(x) unlist(strsplit(x, " ", fixed = TRUE))[1])))
```

NOTE: the input of ptms_network is the output of the FindCommonCluster function not bound in the list.

In this step, the GenerateAndConstructptmsNetwork function takes the common clusters you identified in the previous step to create a network of Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs). PTMs are chemical modifications that occur after a protein is produced, and understanding these modifications is crucial for many biological processes. The function merges the cluster data into a single comprehensive data frame, preparing it for further analysis. This step is essential for connecting the dots between different protein modifications.

### Step 3: BindMatrices
``` {r eval=FALSE}
bound_matrices <- BindMatrices(cluster_list, correlation_matrix)
print("Bound matrices:")
print(list(adj_matrix = adj_matrix_ordered, cccn_matrix = cccn_matrix))
```

The BindMatrices function aligns the adjacency matrix (which represents the relationships between different entities) with the correlation matrix (which indicates how closely related different observations are). By setting diagonal connections to NA, this function helps clean up the data and ensures that only relevant relationships are analyzed.

### Step 4: CorrelationNetwork
```{r eval=FALSE}
correlation_network <- CorrelationNetwork(bound_matrices)
print("Correlation network:")
print(igraph::graph_from_adjacency_matrix(as.matrix(cccn_matrix0), mode = "lower", diag = FALSE, weighted = "Weight"))
```

Finally, the CorrelationNetwork function takes the bound matrices and transforms them into an igraph object. This object represents a network where nodes correspond to genes or proteins, and edges represent relationships between them. Analyzing this correlation network allows you to understand the complex interactions between different proteins in your dataset, offering insights into their functional relationships.

### Step 5: Purge Zeros
```{r eval=FALSE}
zero_na_data <- zero.to.NA.func(correlation_network)
print("Data with zeroes replaced by NA:")
print(zero_na_data)
```

This function, which is smaller than most of ours, is just turning every zero in the given data set to an NA value. This is so that later on these missing numbers to not affect our workflow. 

### Step 6: Process PTM Data
```{r eval=FALSE}
processed_data_path <- process_ptms_data(eu.sp.sed.ptms, sed.ptms.peps, cccn_matrix)
print("Processed PTM data:")
print(ptms_gene_cccn_edges)
```

Once again we run this function in the same manner as the others. This function has more steps than most of the others. It creates an adjacency matrix based on the Euclidean, Spearman, and combined data sets, and sorts them based on their values. Then, it checks the data set and adds correlation as edge values in the adjacency matrix.
